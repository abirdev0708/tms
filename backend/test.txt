React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces with reusable components. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM, improving application performance. React follows a declarative programming paradigm, allowing developers to describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the rendering. The component-based architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability, making it ideal for large-scale applications. React uses JSX, a syntax extension that combines HTML and JavaScript, enabling developers to write component logic and UI together. State management in React allows components to store and manage data, while props enable communication between parent and child components. React's unidirectional data flow simplifies debugging and makes applications more predictable. The library has a thriving ecosystem with tools like React Router for navigation and Redux for state management. React's popularity stems from its flexibility, strong community support, and extensive documentation. Whether building single-page applications or complex dashboards, React provides developers with the tools needed to create dynamic, responsive web applications efficiently.
